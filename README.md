# React Performance Demo

This project demonstrates various React performance optimization techniques and best practices.

## Overview

This application serves as a learning resource for understanding key React performance concepts including:
- `useMemo` hook
- `useCallback` hook
- `React.memo`
- Component optimization strategies

## Features

- **Performance Demo**: Interactive examples showing performance optimizations
- **Callback Demo**: Demonstrates proper use of useCallback hook
- **Memo Demo**: Shows React.memo implementation
- **UseMemo Demo**: Examples of useMemo hook usage
- **Authentication**: Basic login functionality
- **Product List**: Sample product listing implementation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
or
yarn install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
or
yarn start
```

## Performance Optimization Examples

### 1. useMemo Demo
- Prevents expensive calculations on every render
- Demonstrates proper dependency array usage
- Shows performance comparison with and without memoization

### 2. useCallback Demo
- Illustrates function memoization
- Prevents unnecessary child component re-renders
- Shows proper event handler optimization

### 3. React.memo Demo
- Component level memoization
- Props comparison strategies
- Performance monitoring examples

### 4. Performance Best Practices
- Code splitting examples
- Lazy loading implementation
- State management optimization

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from create-react-app

### Code Style

This project follows the standard React/JavaScript style guide:
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- PropTypes for runtime type checking

## Testing

The project includes examples of:
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Performance testing
